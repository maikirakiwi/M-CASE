<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About

This really started out as a project out of personal interest/hobby in Audio Processing. Now that variations of the sub-project has been licensed and commercialized. (A very extensive fork of KACEE/M-CASE specifically designed for a Chinese streaming platform) It only serves to further interest me in the field of audio with my very limited but growing programming knowledge.      

Here's why this repository is important:
* One of the few extensively detailed & documented resource for audio processing available for free of charge.
* Voluntarily bringing together the audio community into maintaining and enhancing audio processing for humankind.
* Rescue some of my really poorly recorded audio samples and apply things learned to possibly other clips.
* Showing people how far an individual can reach out of their sole interest in this particular topic.

The need for more open-sourced researches regarding Digital Signal Processing are paramount for the dying industry to be revived by the community. So, I hope this repo will serve as an inspiration to you, the person reading this! 

Academic references and rightholders are stated in acknowledgements.

## Framework
My research involved heavily in endless trials and errors of different combination of the system for each of my projects. As a result, the dependencies of each of the extension to my research are extremely hard to keep track of. For this exact purpose, the following dependencies mentioned are only the most significant/notable ones.

### KACEE
(Previously M-CASE)
* [ATRAC9/LDAC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adaptive_Transform_Acoustic_Coding)
* [HE-AAC/ISO 14496-3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-Efficiency_Advanced_Audio_Coding)

### KACEE-S
(Previously M-CASE-SEC)
* TBD

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Projects

Below are specific descriptions of each of the project in this branch.

### Prerequisites

* Basic knowledge in how sound physically works and how they are processed through digital means. 

### KACEE

#### Kiwi's Auditory Cognitive Enhancement Engine 
(Previously M-CASE)


<!-- ROADMAP -->
## Roadmap

### 2021
* Restructuring of my personal project and organize them under one big name. (Done)
* TBA
