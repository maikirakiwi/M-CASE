# M-CASE
Maikira's Computational Audio Spectral Enhancement Engine

Pronounced as *Ma' Case* (Yes I know terrible name)
Semi-open source code to improve listener's perception of audio quality on a psychoacoustic level when given a compressed audio source. This does not necessarily "upscale" any source to a higher quality, for that, you need to remaster the original source. 

Developed based on my past experience as an Audio Engineer & working at different companies.

# Project Goals: 
- Reduce transient smearing
- Reduce CPU usage / complexity of processing
- Wider compatibility instead of a dedicated audio plugin (rethink way to achieve this)
- Native Support with Discord's Audio Subsystem
- A lighter mode of operation for speeches/voice chat only (Discord)

# Current Status: (Last Updated 4 June 2021)
> UPDATE: (06/04/2020) As per new agreement with the Party, this repo is allowed to be updated again for solely demonstration purposes outside Mainland China. Please do not spread this to Mainland China if you are from any of those regions. 

> Effect is audibly better. Revised Algorithm increases efficiency by up to 300% compared to initial build.
> Near Real-Time processing is in sight and will be built-in to the Recorder's firmware by the end of 2021. 

# Development Build Instructions:
> TBD, I will figure this out later.

The proposed algorithm employs sparse recovery, a compressed sensing technique, and assumes the position of the source signals are unknown. A formal listening test was conducted to evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm and the results indicate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. keywords: {array signal processing;compressed sensing;harmonic analysis;microphone arrays;signal resolution;super-resolution beamforming algorithm;spherical microphone arrays;compressed sensing approach;spherical harmonic domain;sparse recovery;compressed sensing technique;source signals;formal listening test;performance evaluation;Array signal processing;Microphone arrays;Signal resolution;Spatial resolution;Acoustics;Signal processing algorithms;Spherical Microphone Arrays;Source Localization;Beamforming;Compressed Sensing},URL:Â https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6637728&isnumber=6637585
