# M-CASE
Maikira's Computational Audio Spectrum Enhancement Engine

Pronounced as Ma' Case (Yes I know terrible name)
Semi-open source code to improve listener's perception of audio quality on a psychoacoustic level when given a compressed audio source. This does not necessarily "upscale" any source to a higher quality, for that, you need to remaster the original source. 

Developed based on my past experience as an Audio Engineer & working at different companies.

Current Status: Effect is only minimal (no clear of improvement shown in ABX testing) 

# Development Build Instructions:
> The complexity of this project makes it almost impossible to deploy on other machines at a scale. As this is only POC for now, I will figure this out later.

The proposed algorithm employs sparse recovery, a compressed sensing technique, and assumes the position of the source signals are unknown. A formal listening test was conducted to evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm and the results indicate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. keywords: {array signal processing;compressed sensing;harmonic analysis;microphone arrays;signal resolution;super-resolution beamforming algorithm;spherical microphone arrays;compressed sensing approach;spherical harmonic domain;sparse recovery;compressed sensing technique;source signals;formal listening test;performance evaluation;Array signal processing;Microphone arrays;Signal resolution;Spatial resolution;Acoustics;Signal processing algorithms;Spherical Microphone Arrays;Source Localization;Beamforming;Compressed Sensing},URL:Â https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6637728&isnumber=6637585
